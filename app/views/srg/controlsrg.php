<h2>Institute SRG for Control Theory and Control System : </h2>

<p>It is the extension of department wide SRG activity. Considering the fact that control systems theory is common to various discipline of engineering a institute wide reading group of all the relevant branches will be great asset to the Institute.

We believe that this will take us to new realm of collaborative research and bring the various specializations close enough to produce some phenomenal research output. </p>
<br />
In addition to goals stated for Students Reading Group, following is expected outcome specific to this Institute Students Reading Group:
<ul>
<li> Improvement in collaborative research</li>
<li> Understanding new trends in control theory and control systems</li>
<li> Enhancement in the interaction between various specialization and research groups.</li>
