<p>This project is about making a room automation system capable of automatically controlling appliances based on the current conditions or by taking user input. Sensors like LDR for light intensity, DHT for temperature and humidity, 2 lasers to detect person entering and exiting the room are used to determine the current conditions and according to the readings obtained, light, fan, AC are controlled. The user can change the settings for automatic control or even override it through a webpage. Lastly, manual switches (in the form of pushbuttons which toggle appliance state) can also be used by the user if he prefers so.</p>
