<div>1) <strong><u>Real time video was obtained through webcam.</u></strong></div><div>2) <strong><u>Detection of moving objects</u></strong>:</div><div>Background subtraction operator(GMG) was used to detect the moving objects. Basically what it does is it assumes the previous frame to be a background and subtracts it from the current frame. Hence only the new foreground in the current frame is obtained. In this way only moving objects can be detected. Also it converts the original image into binary image with foreground as white and background as black.</div><div>3) <u><strong>Identifying the contours:</strong></u></div><div>After background subtraction, contours i.e, change in color was identified and a boundary was drawn around it. These boundaries, rectangles traced the moving vehicles in original video.</div><div>4)<strong><u>Recognizing of vehicles:</u></strong></div><div>Once the rectangles traced the moving vehicles, we drew a line on screen. Then every time the centroid of these rectangles crossed the line, we calculated its area. In this way we found out an average value of area of car, heavy vehicles, scooters, autos, humans.</div><div>We classified them accordingly and then each time a rectangle with particular area crossed the line, we increased the count if it lied in specified range.</div><div>To count the number of stationary vehicles at red signal, there was no particular algorithm in order to find out the number of stationary objects of varying shape and colors. So we came up with  a solution that these cameras would be installed before the signal so we would count the number of vehicles normally but these would be the vehicles that would be stopping at the red signals after crossing the camera. In this way we could calculate the total number of vehicles.</div>
