<li>The Arduino UNO R3 is a microcontroller board based on the ATmega328. It has 14 digital input/output pins (of which 6 can be used as PWM outputs), 6 analog inputs, a 16 MHz crystal oscillator, a USB connection, a power jack, an ICSP header, and a reset button. It contains everything needed to support the microcontroller; simply connect it to a computer with a USB cable or power it with a AC-to-DC adapter or battery to get started.<br>The UNO differs from all preceding boards because it does not use the FTDI USB-to-serial driver chip.<br>Additional features coming with the REV3 version are:<br>
<ul>
<li>ATmega16U2 instead of 8U2 as USB-to-Serial converter.</li><li>1.0 pinout: added SDA and SCL pins for TWI communication placed near to the AREF pin and two other new pins placed near to the RESET pin, the IOREF that allow the shields to adapt to the voltage provided from the board and the second one is a not connected pin, that is reserved for future purposes.</li><li>Stronger RESET circuit.</li></ul><p>"Uno" means "One" in Italian and is named to mark the upcoming release of Arduino 1.0. The Uno and version 1.0 will be the reference versions of Arduino, moving forward. The Uno is the latest in a series of USB Arduino boards, and the reference model for the Arduino platform.</p></li><li>

A small current entering the base is amplified to produce a large collector and emitter current. That is, when there is a positive potential difference measured from the emitter of an NPN transistor to its base (i.e., when the base is <strong>high</strong> relative to the emitter) as well as positive potential difference measured from the base to the collector, the transistor becomes active. In this "on" state, current flows between the collector and emitter of the transistor. Most of the current is carried by electrons moving from emitter to collector as minority carriers in the P-type base region. To allow for greater current and faster operation, most bipolar transistors used today are NPN becauseelectron mobility is higher than hole mobility.</li><li>View <a href="http://www.farnell.com/datasheets/661741.pdf" target="_blank">Datasheet (2N-4401)</a></li></ul><hr><h3>TEMPERATURE SENSOR (LM-35)</h3><p><img src="http://hub360.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/LM35.jpg" style="width: 200px;"></p><ul><li>The LM35 series are precision integrated-circuit temperature devices with an output voltage linearly-proportional to the Centigrade temperature. The LM35 device has an advantage over linear temperature sensors calibrated in Kelvin, as the user is not required to subtract a large constant voltage from the output to obtain convenient Centigrade scaling. The LM35 device does not require any external calibration or trimming to provide typical accuracies of ±¼°C at room temperature and ±¾°C over a full −55°C to 150°C temperature range. Lower cost is assured by trimming and calibration at the wafer level. The low-output impedance, linear output, and precise inherent calibration of the LM35 device makes interfacing to readout or control circuitry especially easy.</li><li>Features:<br><ul><li>Calibrated Directly in Celsius (Centigrade)</li><li>Linear + 10-mV/°C Scale Factor</li><li>0.5°C Ensured Accuracy (at 25°C)</li><li>Rated for Full −55°C to 150°C Range</li><li>Suitable for Remote Applications</li><li>Low-Cost Due to Wafer-Level Trimming</li><li>Operates from 4 V to 30 V</li><li>Less than 60-μA Current Drain</li><li>Low Self-Heating, 0.08°C in Still Air</li><li>Non-Linearity Only ±¼°C Typical</li><li>Low-Impedance Output, 0.1 Ω for 1-mA Load</li></ul></li><li>View <a href="http://www.ece.usu.edu/ece_store/spec/lm35dt-3p.pdf" target="_blank">Datasheet(LM-35)</a></li></ul><hr><h3>MOSFET (2N-7000)</h3><p><img src="http://blog-imgs-24.fc2.com/m/y/k/mykeita/200905101412364e5.jpg" style="width: 218px;"></p><ul><li>The <strong>2N7000</strong> is a  N-channel, enhancement-modeMOSFETs used for low-power switching applications.</li><li> Typical use of these transistors is as a switch for moderate voltages and currents, including as drivers for small lamps, motors, and relays.

In the dark, a photoresistor can have a resistance as high as several megohms (MΩ), while in the light, a photoresistor can have a resistance as low as a few hundred ohms. If incident light on a photoresistor exceeds a certain frequency, photons absorbed by the semiconductor give bound electrons enough energy to jump into the conduction band. The resulting free electrons (and their hole partners) conduct electricity, thereby lowering resistance. The resistance range and sensitivity of a photoresistor can substantially differ among dissimilar devices. Moreover, unique photoresistors may react substantially differently to photons within certain wavelength bands.</p><p>View <a href="http://www.biltek.tubitak.gov.tr/gelisim/elektronik/.../LDR_NSL19_M51.pdf" target="_blank">Datasheet (LDR)</a></p><hr>
<h3>RELAY ( JQC-3FC-T73 5V )</h3><p><img src="http://cdn2.bigcommerce.com/server3700/8d73a/products/364/images/962/relay__43794.1409204551.1280.1280.JPG?c=2" style="width: 261px;"></p></ul><ul>
<p>A relay is an electrically activated switch. It consists of a coil internally which will creates a magnetic field that attracts a movable lever and then changes switch contacts when a current is flowing through it. The typical usage of relay is to allow a low DC voltage circuit (circuit #1) to switch on or off a high voltage (DC or AC) circuit (circuit #2) without direct electrical connection between them. This means circuit #1 and circuit #2 are magnetically and mechanically linked but not electrically connected.</p><p>View <a href="http://www.langirele.com/pdf/pcb-relay-T73.pdf" target="_blank">Datasheet ( JQC-3FC-T73 )</a></p></ul>
