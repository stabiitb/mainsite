</ol><p>Motor control</p><p>We used L293d ic as the motor driver and 7805 ic to clip the voltage to 5V since arduino oprates on 5V.</p><p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/tpcPMC-4d6x8gEfMqvkNpJpI2W0y0lLuQ4edZ9AgzncknurLe740It1fkHen35v2nWnYmip_WQZ693TGhmLhQWgXRxrY_BjpOcQ_RtA6-rEMO4FfG_LuypXO51FCvLr4FIu2Kv1A0A" width="369px;" height="539px;" alt=""></p></div>
<div>Problems Faced:</div><div>We made the pcb of the above circuit.Since we are new to techniques like soldering we were unable to make one So we decided to make the circuit in a small breadboard.</div><div>Obstacle detection</div><div><p>For obstacle detection we are using ultrasonic sensor(Hc-sro4) mounted over a servo motor so that the sensor has a 180 degree field of view.</p><p><img src="http://thingiverse-production.s3.amazonaws.com/renders/cc/67/df/0e/ce/20141216_094553_preview_featured.jpg"></p></div><ol>Orientation of Vehicle<p>To find the vehicle’s orientation at a particular instant we are using an imu(mpu6050) which has 6 DOF,3 degree each for accelerometer and gyrometer.</p><p>Imu along with pid controller we were able to move the vehicle exactly 90 deg left or right when obstacles comes in the path.</p><p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/sQ8Ez35_6GkXduHRfc00ZOP1KWvcmgqL6as646weaughUoXWdxB5RLsneUjCECZgqQFD23ujqqxJR3oeBIAbihk4R99XfzKOF9W8EXoJFuK4M4c_kro1CgtMsByEdm2QB1bhHHcL_Q" width="613px;" height="398px;"></p><p>Problems Faced</p><p>We were having some problems in the coding part but later it was rectified.</p></ol>
