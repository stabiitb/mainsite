	In this project we aimed at the testing A new type of the suspension</p><p>
	We gave the car a positive camber angle</p><p>
	Camber angle alters the handling qualities of a particular suspension design</p><p>
	Off-road vehicles such as agricultural tractors generally use positive camber. In such vehicles, the positive camber angle helps to achieve a lower steering effort. Also, some single-engined general aviation aircraft that are primarily meant to operate from unimproved surfaces, such as bush planes and cropdusters, have their taildragger gear's main wheels equipped with positive-cambered main wheels to better handle the deflection of the landing gear, as the aircraft settles on rough, unpaved airstrips.</p><p>

	So you can see that our car have the positive one</p><p>
	he another part which we have taken is that Bluetooth module</p><p>
	<img src="http://s5.postimg.org/5wd2mvnzr/download.jpg">this have four pins of our use .namely RX,TX,VCC,ground </p><p>
	the another thing which we have used is L293D</p><p><img src="http://s5.postimg.org/j606egrhz/L293_D_connections.jpg">here we have used three L293d as one supports two motors and we have 6 whee drive </p><p>We have used the nylon thread to support the two tyres in same row </p><p><img src="http://s5.postimg.org/6giwy32gn/IMG_20150610_WA0008.jpg"></p><p style="margin-left: 660px;"></p>
